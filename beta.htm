<h1>Trunker Platform Beta Software</h1>

<h2>What is in this Release?</h2>

<p>This is a beta release of three different Radio Signal
Processing programs: Trunker 3.x, MDT.EXE, and EDACS.EXE. All
three of these programs have been build on top of a common set of
C/C++ routines which represent a &quot;Platform&quot; or
&quot;Environment&quot;. Once one correctly codes a set of
environment variables (via AUTOEXEC.BAT), all three programs will
adapt to the user's configuration of scanner, serial port(s) and
slicer characteristics. In addition to the common environment
variables, each of the components may also respond to
component-specific environment variables.</p>

<h2>Performance Demands</h2>

<p>The following table is the author's current knowledge of the
demands of each program. Please feel free to advise the author
(see &quot;reporting beta issues&quot; below) of updates:</p>

<p>The most common cause of failure to get these programs running
is problems with the environmental variable memory allocation.
Sometimes in Win95 DOS windows, a DOS BAT program will be unable
to change environment variables. By placing the initial settings
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT and updating them in the .BAT files, this
problem seems to be eliminated. The following is a starting point
for updating AUTOEXEC.BAT:</p>

<p>Sample AUTOEXEC.BAT entries</p>

<pre>set TRACKSLICERPIN=CTS
set TRACKSLICERPORT=COM2
set TRACKSLICERMODE=INVERT
set TRACKSCAN=AR8000
set TRACKSCANPORT=COM2
set MDTWIDESCREEN=y
set MDTWIDEFILE=n
</pre>

<p>Step-By-Step Instructions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Add the above lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT, modified to
        your 'best guess' settings:</li>
    <li>Restart DOS/Windows 95 to ensure space is allocated for
        these variables</li>
    <li>Edit each of the .BAT files (edsgo.bat, motgo.bat, and
        mdtgo.bat) prior to executing them.</li>
    <li>If a given component does not function, or you need
        different features, adjust the .BAT file appropriately.</li>
    <li>When you have determined the proper value for each
        variable, edit AUTOEXEC.BAT with the correct value.</li>
    <li>Restart DOS/Windows 95</li>
    <li>You may then execute each .EXE directly without the .BAT
        file or continue to use the xxxGO.BAT files.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Components</h2>

<h3>Platform (initial beta)</h3>

<p>This software is common to the following three packages.
Please read and follow the instructions in the section
&quot;Setting Up&quot; above before attempting to use any of
these packages.</p>

<h3>Trunker Component (beta)</h3>

<p>Trunker understands the protocols and messages of Motorola
Trunked Radio Systems. It displays information about a trunked
system being monitored and can (when provided with two scanners
as described in the documentation) provide trunk-tracking
monitoring capabilities.</p>

<p>The primary features to be tested in this Beta include:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Functioning of the platform code with various scanners,
        ports, and slicer input bits.</li>
    <li>Functioning of the Type-I Fleet Map Decoding and Type-II
        Status Bit Decoding.</li>
    <li>Functioning of specialized support for certain UHF radio
        systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please refer to the recently rewritten <a href="trdoc.htm">Trunker
3.x Documentation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="trunker.zip">This ZIP file includes Trunker.exe and
the motgo.bat file mentioned above.</a></p>

<h3>MDT Component (interim)</h3>

<p>MDT understands the MDC4800 protocol used by some Mobile
Dispatch Terminals. This implementation has not evolved as much
as Trunker, but still can provide some useful information. One
must be cautious about what one does with the disk files created
by MDT, since sending them or showing them to a third party could
be construed as 'disclosing' what you 'heard' on your scanner.</p>

<p>This version is the first release built on the Trunker
Platform. Full documentation is not yet available. Two
environment variables specific to MDT are:</p>

<table border="2" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td><p align="center"><strong>Variable</strong></p>
        </td>
        <td align="center"><p align="center"><strong>Values</strong></p>
        </td>
        <td><p align="center"><strong>Meaning</strong></p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><p align="center"><em>MDTWIDESCREEN</em></p>
        </td>
        <td align="center"><p align="center">y<br>
        n</p>
        </td>
        <td><p align="center">print nearly-readable output to the
        screen<br>
        print hex dump format to the screen</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><p align="center"><em>MDTWIDEFILE</em></p>
        </td>
        <td align="center"><p align="center">y<br>
        n</p>
        </td>
        <td><p align="center">save nearly-readable output to the
        file<br>
        save hex dump format to the file</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><a href="mdt.zip">This ZIP file includes MDT.EXE and the
mdtgo.bat file mentioned above.</a></p>

<p>The author is open to suggestion regarding future features.
One already in the works is the interpretation of the ANSI X3.64
escape sequences in 'wide' mode.</p>

<h3>EDACS (experimental)</h3>

<p>This program is in its toddler stages. It was only posted
(anonymously) last December to netnews. This version is useful
for further identifying the characteristics of the EDACS trunked
system. In its present form, source code modifications are
required to get it to 'Trunk Track'. (The full source code for
all three programs and the platform will be made publicly
available at the end of the beta test.) It is expected that the
next version of EDACS.EXE will have the look, feel, and functions
of the Motorola Trunker.EXE, and will be able to trunk-track with
any of the supported scanners.</p>
