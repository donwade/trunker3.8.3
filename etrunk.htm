<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>Some time ago there appeared on USENET a program and its
source code that provided the rudimentary ability to decode
Motorola Type I, II, and IIi trunking radio system data. That
program was nurtured and refined by a number of contributors.
Then, a rudimentary program for decoding Ericsson/GE data
channels was posted (anonymously) to USENET. That rudimentary
program was used to investigate further the parts of the data
stream necessary to adapt Trunker to Ericsson/GE systems. This
document represents the results of merging those two efforts. 80%
of the code and features are common to both Trunker and Etrunk. </p>

<h2>Current Feature Status</h2>

<p>This software provides a rudimentary implementation of Trunker
for Ericsson/GE systems. It differs from the Motorola Trunker in
the following ways: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Because E/GE system IDs are limited in size and not
        necessarily unique in an area, it may be necessary to run
        ETRUNK from a different directory for each system you
        monitor. </li>
    <li>ETRUNK does not recognize complex call types (more than 2
        user IDs and/or more than one group ID.)</li>
    <li>While ETRUNK works on a single-channel E/GE system, where
        a single frequency alternates between control channel and
        voice channel, the 'delay' feature is not functional for
        those systems.</li>
    <li>Unlike Trunker, ETRUNK does not yet adapt to multiple
        repeater sites for the same networked system. It will
        recognize that it is monitoring a networked system, but
        will not swap out the repeater files the way Trunker does.</li>
    <li>Because E/GE systems do not utilize standard bandplans,
        it is necessary to manually identify all frequencies
        associated with the E/GE system and update ETRUNK's data
        files with the LCN to Frequency mapping.</li>
    <li><u>This version of ETRUNK now supports Affiliation
        logging. (Thanks to Wayne for figuring out the decoding!)
        Note that not all radios will affiliate, and to see this
        information it is necessary to adjust the settings in the
        'option' sub-menu for 'affiliations' so they will show up
        on the 'screen', be logged to 'disk', or 'both'.</u></li>
    <li><u>This version of ETRUNK now supports &quot;Patches&quot;
        where multiple groups are aliased to a common (temporary)
        group ID for broader dissemination of information and
        cross-unit cooperation. Please note that to see these you
        have to utilize the 'options' sub-menu and change the
        handling of 'patches' from the default value of 'none' to
        &quot;screen&quot;, &quot;disk&quot; or &quot;both&quot;
        to see specific information about what groups are
        participating in the patch.</u></li>
    <li><u>There are now 4800bps E/GE systems out there. To
        access these systems, it will be necessary to run a
        different executable (ETRNK48.EXE.) Sorry, but ETRUNK
        cannot automatically toggle over to 4800 bps.</u></li>
</ul>

<p>Even with this reduced feature set, a user of ETRUNK should be
able to monitor a E/GE system, collect information about
talkgroups and radio IDs, and track both individual and group
calls.</p>

<h2>Please Start by Reading the Motorola (Trunker) Documentation</h2>

<p>Etrunk is so much like Trunker, please <a href="trdoc.htm">start
by reading the Trunker document</a>, then see subsequent sections
about how ETRUNK may be different... </p>

<h2>ETRUNK and Commercial Trunking Radios</h2>

<p>When ETRUNK was initially released, there was no affordable
commercial scanner that could track E/GE systems. There is now
custom software available for the Optoelectronics OPTCOM® radio.
In addition, there has been an announcement of an upcoming Uniden
product that is claimed to track these systems. However, ETRUNK
lets you do so now with your existing scanners.</p>

<h2>Use of System ID (SysId) as Primary Index</h2>

<p>Like its partner, Trunker, ETRUNK uses a system identifier to
associate data files with trunked systems. Since these
identifiers may not be unique within a geographical area, it may
be necessary to keep a working directory for each unique E/GE
system you monitor, and it will probably not be practical to jump
from one system to the next without stopping Etrunk.</p>

<h2>Networked Radio Systems</h2>

<p>Larger E/GE systems share group and radio IDs. Support for
networked systems is not presently available. Each repeater in
the system is treated as a separate system.Until ETRUNK can
distinguish between repeaters, it will be necessary to switch the
proper xxxxSYS into the directory with the common group and radio
data files. In some cases, a given networked system will re-use
the same System ID values in different states. As a result,
sharing the same group/radio data files among networked cells can
be difficult.</p>

<h3>Handling Bandplans for Each E/GE System</h3>

<p>No standard bandplan is available to map LCNs to frequencies.
A manual approach is required to determine the frequencies and
update the ETRUNK data file. </p>

<ol>
    <li>With no xxxxSYS.TXT file in the current directory, start
        ETRUNK.</li>
    <li>Once all of the LCNs associated with the system appear on
        screen, exit ETRUNK with the 'Q' command.</li>
    <li>Edit the xxxxSYS.TXT file. Change all of the hex
        frequencies (e.g. 0x001...0x007) with the corresponding
        frequency in a F8.4 format (e.g. 855.0200).</li>
    <li>Save the file.</li>
    <li>Run ETRUNK again and monitor or track the system as
        desired.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a sample xxxxSYS.TXT file for a E/GE system:</p>

<pre>Clinton County,Ohio E/GE System
MAP=00000000
PLAN=0
  v866.2375,1,ffff
 dv866.7250,2,ffff
  v867.2250,3,ffff
 dv867.7250,4,ffff
  v868.1875,5,ffff
</pre>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
    <li>ETRUNK only operates effectively under MS-DOS at this
        time.</li>
    <li>One must understand that decoding and interpreting data
        at 9600 bits-per-second and looking up records for
        thousands of groups and IDs places a certain demand on a
        CPU. Please don't feel slighted if your 386 or 486 system
        can't handle the demands of ETRUNK. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Quality of Signal</h3>

<p><em><strong>If you cannot achieve sufficiently good reception
to reach 90% accuracy on the data channel, you will be losing
information and may have difficulty receiving the audio as well.
The E/GE version of Trunker provides a spinner in addition to the
blinking '@' sign; both show up when you turn on the 'F'rameIndicator
command. If things are working well the spinner should reach a
vertical position every second. Slower progress means quality is
degraded, perhaps by trying to run ETRUNK under Windows, or
because of poor radio reception. Under degraded conditions,
ETRUNK will lose some calls and may not show calling radio IDs.</strong></em></p>
